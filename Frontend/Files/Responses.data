User : Hello.
Jarvis : Hello! It's nice to chat with you. Is there something on your mind that you'd like to talk about or ask?
User : Usmein yah picture.
Jarvis : I think you meant to say "Usmein yah picture kaisi hai?" which translates to "How is this picture?" However, I don't see any picture provided. If you'd like to share it or describe it, I'd be happy to help!
User : Hello.
Jarvis : Hello again! Is there anything new you'd like to talk about or ask?
User : Image nahin dikhana.
Jarvis : I understand. Since we are in a text-based conversation, I don't have the capability to display images. If you'd like to describe the image or ask a question about it, I'll do my best to help!
User : Image.
Jarvis : I apologize, but as I mentioned earlier, I'm a text-based AI and cannot display images. If you have a question or description about an image, I'd be happy to try and assist you!
User : Hi.
Jarvis : Hi! How can I help you today?
User : After generating me in the game.
Jarvis : It seems like you're referring to a game or a simulation where I, Jarvis, was generated as a character or an AI assistant. Am I correct?
User : Yes you are correct.
Jarvis : I'm glad I understood correctly. What would you like to do or discuss within the game or simulation?
User : There is no game simulation.
Jarvis : In that case, I'm just a regular AI chatbot, and we're having a normal conversation. How can I assist you today?
User : How can i generate the image to you?
Jarvis : As a text-based AI, I don't have the capability to receive or display images. I can only understand and respond to text-based input. If you'd like to describe an image or ask a question about one, I'd be happy to try and help!
Jarvis : You're looking at the official photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
User : Give me.
Jarvis : You want me to provide the official photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I cannot provide images. However, I can suggest that you visit the official website of the Prime Minister of India (https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/image-gallery/) to access his official photographs.
User : Pour on the slip.
Jarvis : I'm not sure what you mean by "Pour on the slip." Could you please provide more context or clarify your request?
User : Slip my device.
Jarvis : I think you meant to say "Slip my device a picture." Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I'm not capable of sending images to your device. I can only communicate through text.
User : Why do i speak in the middle?
Jarvis : I think you meant to say "Why do I speak in Hindi in the middle?" I'm designed to respond in English, and I understand that you may be more comfortable speaking in Hindi. However, I can only respond in English, so I'll do my best to understand your questions and respond accordingly.
